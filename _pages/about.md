I'm a Ph.D. student and radio astronomer in the [New Mexico Tech Physics Department](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/physics/graduatestudents.php) working on bright centers of galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using the [Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vlba/). I'm also a teaching assistant in the physics department teaching the (calculus-based) introductory physics labs and recitations. For more information, see [research](https://gennacrom.github.io/research/) or [teaching](https://gennacrom.github.io/teaching/).

Outside of work, I am an avid amateur radio enthusiast (KJ5BQG) and a flute/piccolo player in the local musical productions.
